# Usage
You will be displayed a piece of <<ins>text</ins>> to open "command window" after (re)loaded the datapack, try clicking on the texts and explore, or wait for the writeup.

# How it Works
Conservation of momentum. Neglected spins of balls, deformations, and interactions with edge of pockets. Assumed friction proportional to speed.

I have not consulted any specific references while making it work. Wait for the writeup or search "simple billiards physics" online.

The [rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_snooker) of snooker has been simplified to meet popular common sense.
